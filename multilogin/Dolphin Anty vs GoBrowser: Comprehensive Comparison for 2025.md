## Dolphin Anty Browser: Features Overview

### 1. Social Media Automation
Dolphin Anty specializes in optimizing paid traffic ads, particularly on platforms like Facebook. Its standout feature is a tool for **automatic Facebook Ad campaigns**, priced at $99/month (excluding the browser cost). While this feature is ideal for affiliates, its high cost may deter users with limited budgets.

Dolphin also includes no-code automation for social media, allowing users to create custom scenarios using blocks. However, the absence of pre-built scenarios or a marketplace limits the convenience of this feature.
